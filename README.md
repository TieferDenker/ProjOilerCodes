# Project Title

Project Euler Codes

## Description

This repository contains all the codes that I've tried to implement for Project Euler.  
Note: The above codes can be divided into the following three categories:  
Correct (Passing all the test cases)                    : 1-16,20-23,25,26,28,30,34-37,42,44,46,53,56,57,58,63,64  
Partially correct (Passing almost all of the test cases): 27,47,49  
Incorrect (Passing almost no test cases)                : 18,29,39,50,55

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Use windows 10 or above and python 3 or above

### Installing

Basic packages and libraries of python are required which I assume are already there in your system

### Executing program

Just run the code (which is basically a Python script (".py" files)) in the terminal from the command line using the command:  
py script_name.py

## Help

Feel free to contact me in case you face any problem while running the code or if you get a better solution (which I'm sure you surely will).  
The problems which I'm not able to solve are left to the coders as an exercise!
